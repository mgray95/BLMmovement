<h2>The Start of the All Lives Matter Movement</h2>
 <p>In 2013, nearly immediately after the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter began appearing online, the hashtag #AllLivesMatter was born. 
  
<h2>Criticism</h2>
  <p>BLM activists and Academics have stated that All Lives Matter is racist, dismissive and ignorant. It completely ignores the fact that black lives specifically are being treated as less than other lives, specifically lives of white individuals. Founders of the BLM movement stated "#BlackLivesMatter doesn't mean your life isn't important â€“ it means that Black lives, which are seen without value within White supremacy, are important to your liberation."
