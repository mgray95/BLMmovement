<p>Blue Lives Matter is a movement in the United States created in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, after two NYPD officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, were murdered in Brooklyn, New York on December 2014.</p>

<h2>Success and Criticism</h2>
<p>The Blue Lives Matter movement has been successful in Louisiana, where a state law was created that made it a hate crime to target police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical service personnel.This law has been heavily criticized for extending hate crime law protections outside of characteristics such as race, sexual orientation, or gender identity, to include career choice. Also, evidence that violence against police officers is decreasing has been used to call into question the motivations for the law.</p>

<p>Another criticism of the movement is that one's job can never reach a deep identity significance and source of solidarity that one's racial identity can. Black identity and history is constantly under threat of erasure, whereas police officers do not face this threat and can choose their profession. Another source of criticism is police officers are typically respected and honored in communities while African Americans in urban areas are suspected of being thieves and freeloaders.Finally, some state supporters of Blue Lives Matter are intentionally or unintentionally supporting a system of discriminatory policing and racial profiling.</p>
