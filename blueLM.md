<p>Blue Lives Matter is a movement in the United States created in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, after two NYPD officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, were murdered in Brooklyn, New York on December 2014.</p>

<p>The movement has been successful in Louisiana, where a state law was created that made it a hate crime to target police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical service personnel.This law has been heavily criticized for extending hate crime law protections outside of characteristics such as race, sexual orientation, or gender identity, to include career choice.Also, evidence that violence against police officers is decreasing has been used to call into question the motivations for the law.</p>
